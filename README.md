# appStore
appStore is UI built with `expo` for an imaginary e-commerce company. Even though it is not integrated to a backend
you will be able to navigate the pages to see the intended features.

To test the app:
- Clone the repository
- run `npm i` or `yarn install`
- run `npm run start`
- scan the barcode with the `expo` app installed on your phone (preferably `android`) since it is not optimized for ios.
