# appStore
appStore is UI built with expo/React native for a imaginary e-commerce. Even though it is not integrated to a backend
you can be able to navigate the pages.

To test the app:
- Clone the repository
- run `npm i` or `yarn install`
- run `npm run start`
- scan the barcode with you expo app install in your phone (preferably android) since it is not optimized for ios.
